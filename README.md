&emsp; ùóõùó≤ùóπùóπùóº, and Welcome to my GitHub page. Feel free to peruse at your leisure. If I may be so bold as to point you to a few of my favorite projects. The three I have in mind are all passion projects that I tackled outside of school. 

&emsp; One is my [PDX to TXT converter](https://github.com/BriChavez/pdf_txt_converter), it was a bi-product of another of my codes. I found myself with a bunch of PDFs that I needed to turn into txt files in order to play with them in Python. Instead of transforming them one at a time using an online converter, I decided to write a code to do the work for me using PYPDF2. Just entering a folder path will take all of the PDF's inside that folder, loop through each page in the file, and read it into a txt file. Tho, with tweaking of just a few words, you could pretty much use it to translate PDFs to any file format. 

&emsp; Next up, is my [interactive Google Data Studio map](https://brichavez.github.io/dbt_world_cup/) and experiment with ELT on the DBT platform. **This one is fun because as you make different selections, all of the graphs and maps update to reflect the related information.** As I am more familiar with ETL, it was an interesting learning experience and super fun to challenge my brain into thinking about pipelines in a different way. Playing around in Google Data Studio helped me deeper understand the importance of and how to better clean data. And, boy oh boy, did I get intimate with Google BigQuery.


&emsp; I saved my favorite for last. This is my [Dr. Seuss markov](https://github.com/markov/) that I wrote pretty much from scratch. Coolest part about this code is that **you can use any text you want**. The only library I used was Numpy for the random number generator. For more on Markovs and how they work, there is further explanation in the project's README.
I did also write [another](https://github.com/BriChavez/mark_capstone) that was made to write cover letters. This one not only saves contractions, but after they enter the dictionaries, we expand them. It also runs through spell check at the end and can make for some very hilarious and fun cover letters.
